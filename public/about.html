<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m [Balamurugan], a passionate web developer currently diving deep into the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).

  I recently completed learning HTML5 and successfully built my first personal portfolio website. Every day, I’m taking consistent steps toward becoming a full-stack developer by building projects, learning new technologies, and sharpening my skills.
  
  I believe in learning by doing — and I'm excited to keep sharing my journey, projects, and growth with the tech community here.</p>
